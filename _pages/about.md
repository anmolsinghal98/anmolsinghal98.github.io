I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the [Software and Societal Systems Department at CMU]("https://s3d.cmu.edu/") where I am advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~breaux/">Dr. Travis Breaux</a>. My research interests include information extraction, document processing, and legal language processing. During my Ph.D., I aspire to build LLM-powered assistants that can aid human experts ensure the legal accountability of software. 

Prior to CMU, I was a researcher at the Requirements and Contract Analysis group at <a href="https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/research">TCS Research</a>, India where I worked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-smita-s-ghaisas-b5504247/?originalSubdomain=in">Dr. Smita Ghaisas</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-preethu-rose-a-5831682b/">Dr. Preethu Anish</a> on addressing real-world problems in contract management. I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science from <a href="https://iiitd.ac.in/">IIIT Delhi</a> in 2021, where I completed my thesis as part of the <a href="https://midas.iiitd.ac.in/">Multimodal Digital Media Analysis (MIDAS) Lab</a>. During my Bachelors, I was also a part of the <a href="https://hmi.iiitd.edu.in/">Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) Lab</a> and the <a href="https://kracr.iiitd.edu.in/">Knowledge Computing and Reasoning (KRaCR) Lab</a>.
