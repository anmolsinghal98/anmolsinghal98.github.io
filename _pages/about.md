I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Software and Societal Systems Department](https://s3d.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am advised by [Dr. Travis Breaux](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~breaux). My research bridges Software Engineering and Natural Language Processing, with a focus on designing intelligent systems that improve communication in software developmentâ€”both among developers and between developers and domain experts. I am particularly interested in how AI agents can facilitate complex human interactions in early-stage software design. Currently, I am developing AI-driven tools to help teach and support developers in conducting effective requirements elicitation interviews.

Prior to CMU, I was a researcher at the Requirements and Contract Analysis group at [TCS Research](https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/research), India where I worked with [Dr. Smita Ghaisas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-smita-s-ghaisas-b5504247/) and [Dr. Preethu Anish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-preethu-rose-a-5831682b/) on addressing real-world problems in contract management. I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science from [IIIT Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in/) in 2021, where I completed my thesis as part of the [Multimodal Digital Media Analysis (MIDAS) Lab](https://midas.iiitd.ac.in/). During my Bachelors, I was also a part of the [Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) Lab](https://hmi.iiitd.edu.in/) and the [Knowledge Computing and Reasoning (KRaCR) Lab](https://kracr.iiitd.edu.in/).
