I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the [Software and Societal Systems Department at CMU](https://s3d.cmu.edu/) where I am advised by [Dr. Travis Breaux](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~breaux). My research interests include document processing, legal language understanding, and machine-guided requirements engineering. During my Ph.D., I aspire to build LLM-powered assistants that can aid human experts ensure the legal accountability of software. 

Prior to CMU, I was a researcher at the Requirements and Contract Analysis group at [TCS Research](https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/research), India where I worked with [Dr. Smita Ghaisas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-smita-s-ghaisas-b5504247/) and [Dr. Preethu Anish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-preethu-rose-a-5831682b/) on addressing real-world problems in contract management. I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science from [IIIT Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in/) in 2021, where I completed my thesis as part of the [Multimodal Digital Media Analysis (MIDAS) Lab](https://midas.iiitd.ac.in/). During my Bachelors, I was also a part of the [Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) Lab](https://hmi.iiitd.edu.in/) and the [Knowledge Computing and Reasoning (KRaCR) Lab](https://kracr.iiitd.edu.in/).
